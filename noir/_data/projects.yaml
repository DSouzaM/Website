- name: Language Analysis
  logo: /assets/projects/la-icon.png
  short: A project to identify similarities in programming languages
  details: >
    I wanted to build something in Scala, but didn't know what people typically used Scala for.
    GitHub tags repositories by the primary language, so I had the idea to try and cluster programming languages based on keywords in repositories' README's - in Scala.

- name: Employment Stats
  logo: /assets/projects/es-icon.png
  short: A project to explore co-op employment rates
  details: >
    Co-op employment information is available through a (somewhat limited) web interface.
    I wanted something a little more useful for understanding the data, so I built a tool to scrape employment information,
    and created a UI to explore the data.

  short: A project to analyze the impact a major League of Legends patch had on the way the game was played.
  details: >
    Riot Games held an API Challenge looking for projects which made use of their new API.
    They had recently released a pretty significant patch which we suspected would change the "meta" of the game, and sought out to look for those changes.
    We processed hundreds of thousands of matches from the API and aggregated the results for exploration in a frontend.

  short: A Chrome extension which provides easy access and visualization of WatCard account usage
  details: >

    I created this extension to make balance and transaction information readily accessible and easy to view.
    Built for EngHack 2015.

- name: UWFlow Plus
  logo: /assets/projects/ufp-icon.png
  short: A Chrome extension to integrate UWFlow information directly into the course calendar
  details: >
    UWFlow is a website which aggregates student reviews of courses at UW.
    I found it tedious to keep flipping back between the official UW course calendar and UWFlow, so I created a Chrome extension which made that info accessible within the course calendar.
