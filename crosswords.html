<p>
Over the past couple years I've gotten pretty into crosswords. I thought it'd be fun to try making my own.
You can download the .puz files and open them in your crossword app of choice (<a href="https://www.crosswordnexus.com/solve/">here's a web interface</a>).
This is a new hobby for me, so I'd love to hear any feedback you have!

<ul>
{% for puzzle in site.data.crosswords %}
   <li><a id="{{puzzle.anchor}}" href="{{puzzle.file}}">{{puzzle.name}}</a> ({{puzzle.date}})</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
