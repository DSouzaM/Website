Welcome to my website! I'm Matt.

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at UWaterloo (co-advised by [Patrick Lam][plam] and [Gregor Richards][gregor]). My research interests are in programming languages, compilers, and runtime systems.

I'm also a big fan of [music], an avid [volleyball player]{:target="_blank"}, and a [pretty cool guy][citation needed].

Feel free to check out my [resume]{:target="_blank"} or reach out to me at [matt.dsouza@gmail.com][email].
